# Interactive Reversible Debugger (IRD)

The **Interactive Reversible Debugger (IRD)** is an open-source debugging tool that enables **step-by-step reversible execution** of programs. Unlike traditional debuggers, IRD allows users to move both **forwards and backwards** in execution, making it easier to track state changes, debug complex logic, and analyze algorithm behavior.

## Features

- **Step Forward & Backward Execution** – Navigate through program states in both directions.

- **Graph-Based Object Visualization** – Inspect linked lists, trees, and complex data structures in real-time.

- **Execution Trace Tracking** – View a detailed step history and reverse execution flow.

- **Breakpoints & Checkpoints** – Set reversible breakpoints and jump to key points in execution.

- **Quantum Algorithm Support** – Debug reversible computations and quantum circuits.

- **Educational Mode** – Interactive UI for learning programming concepts through visualization.

- **IDE & API Integration** – Plugin support for VSCode, PyCharm, and other environments.
